      <h2>Data Sonification</h1>
      <p>This means that you use sounds to communicate what the data means. So, you
        would play different notes/tones to represent different changes being
        represented in the data visualization. </p>
    </div>
    <div class='d2'>
      <h2>Proportional Representation</h1>
      <p>This means using different areas to represent the data. It will allow the
        reader to compare the whole to its smaller parts. </p>
    </div>
    <div class='d3'>
      <h2>Connected Scatter Plot</h1>
      <p>This is a graph that looks like a scatter plot, except that all of the dots are
         connected from the first change to the last. This shows changes through
         comparing where the scatter plot started off at to where it is now.</p>
